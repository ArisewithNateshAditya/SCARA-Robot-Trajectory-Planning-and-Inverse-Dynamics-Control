Project Name: SCARA Robot Trajectory Planning and Inverse Dynamics Control

Description:
This project focuses on generating a 4-second trajectory for a SCARA robot with a trapezoidal velocity profile, including plots of position, velocity, and acceleration. It also covers inverse dynamics control with a 5 kg load, calculating joint setpoints using a second-order kinematic inversion algorithm.

File Structure:

Project_Report_3.pdf - Detailed report including trajectory generation, velocity and acceleration plots, and inverse dynamics control.
Trajectory_Generation.m - Matlab script for generating and plotting the robot’s trajectory, velocity, and acceleration.
Inverse_Dynamics_Control.m - Matlab script for computing inverse dynamics and joint setpoints.
Plots/ - Folder containing plots of position, velocity, acceleration, and error metrics.
Visualization/ - Folder with visualizations of the SCARA manipulator.
Installation and Usage:
Ensure Matlab is installed on your system. Open and run the provided scripts (Trajectory_Generation.m and Inverse_Dynamics_Control.m) to generate and analyze the robot’s trajectory and control data.
